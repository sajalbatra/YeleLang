### **YeleLang: A Simple Custom Programming Language**

Welcome to YeleLang! This is a simple yet powerful programming language built on top of C++ that allows you to declare variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print results. The language was created as part of a learning project to explore language design, lexers, and parsers. This README provides an overview of the language, how to use it, and how to set up the development environment.

---

### **Features:**
- **Variable Declaration**: `yele` keyword for declaring variables and assigning values.
- **Operations**: Use `yekar` for performing operations like addition and subtraction.
- **Output**: Use `printkr` to print the result of a calculation or a variable.

---

### **Example Code:**
```cpp
// Declare variables
yele x = 5
yele y = 10

// Perform arithmetic operations
yekar z = x + y

// Print the result
printkr z
```

### **Expected Output:**
```
15
```

### **How It Works:**
1. **Lexer**: The lexer scans through the input code, dividing it into tokens like keywords (`yele`, `yekar`, `printkr`), variable names, operators (`+`, `-`), and values.
2. **Parser**: The parser reads the tokens generated by the lexer, identifies the operations to be performed (e.g., assignment, arithmetic), and executes them.
3. **Execution**: The parsed operations are executed in the C++ environment, with results being printed or stored in variables.

### **Installation and Setup:**

To try out YeleLang, you need a C++ compiler (like g++) and a development environment.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajalbatra/YeleLang.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd YeleLang
   ```

3. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o yelelang main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./yelelang
   ```

You can modify the source code to write your own programs and experiment with the syntax.
